Introduction
---------------------------------
The post processing reads the water and ice netcdf file and on the
basis of some pre defined QC information selects the best match and
writes this out to a new netcdf file.


To run the code
---------------------------
1. Modify make file to point to the correct libraries
>make post_process_level2

The information on which files to read in is contained in the
posprocessing*.dat file

This file should be automatically generated by the orac code.

> post_process_level2

a file with the 'ICE' and 'WAT' removed will be generated.

This file should be exactly the same format as the individual ice and
water files.

Fortran compilers tested
------------------------
intel fortran
gfortran


How to modify quality control:
---------------------------------
A limited number of quailty control to identify the best phase for the
output file is implemented in the main program. the threshold for the
QC can be modified in the postprocessing*.dat file without having to
recompile the fortran.

Extra quality control can be easily added into the main program.
