read_orac_nc_pp is the main program the other files are called by this program

Look in the header of this file to see examples of how to run the code
 typical usage idl>

AVHRR files should run using this command
x=read_orac_nc_pp(/plot,dirin='/misc/wantage_static/cpoulsen/cloud_ecv/postproc/2009/01/10/',chsize=1000,/forc,version='fv2.0',/istomina,/ps,/i37)


files need to have this format inorder to be read into the code

Note I had to change your file names slightly to run with the code

20090110090000-ESACCI-L2_CLOUD-CLD_PRODUCTS-AVHRRGAC-NOAA18-fv2.0.primary.nc
20090110090000-ESACCI-L2_CLOUD-CLD_PRODUCTS-AVHRRGAC-NOAA18-fv2.0.secondary.nc


The plots I think are more informative when the 'clear' scenes are run as well

NB this code is not that neat!
